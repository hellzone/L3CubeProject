In this assignment we are simulating the searching of duplicate files on hard drive in a directory. 
The user can select any directory in which the duplicate files are to be found.
The duplicate files are found on the basis of their names and md5 hashing algorithm.
If files with same name exist under a directory subtree then their md5 hash is checked to find duplication.
The user is given option to delete or retain a file.
